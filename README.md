# ExposureLadder

An Android application to help people overcome fears through exposure therapy. Based on my own knowledge and experience with exposure therapy and designed to be simple yet effective. 

Currently the app is no more than a diary log to track experiences. The idea is to develop a scoring system with graphs and visuals to encourage users to reach their targets.
